          fifteen Filmfare Awards and seventeen Filmfare Awards South. He has been awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian award, in 2010 by the Government of India.[2] In 2009, Rahman was included on the Time 100 list of the world's
          most influential people.[3] The UK-based world-music magazine Songlines named him one of "Tomorrow's World Music Icons" in August 2011.[4]

          He is nicknamed "Isai Puyal"(English: the Musical Storm) and "Mozart of Madras".[5] With an in-house studio (Panchathan Record Inn in Chennai), Rahman's film-scoring career began during the early 1990s with the Tamil film Roja. Working in
          India's film industries, international cinema, and theatre, Rahman is one of the best-selling recording artists,[6][7][8] with an estimated 150 million units sold worldwide.[9][10][11] Rahman has also become a notable humanitarian and
          philanthropist, donating and raising money for a number of causes and charities. In 2017, Rahman made his debut as a director and writer for the film Le Musk.[12]
